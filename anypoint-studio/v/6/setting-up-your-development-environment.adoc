= Anypoint Studio Setup

Setting up a proper development environment is crucial for a successful use of the Mule Runtime. +
The following document outlines the steps to be taken before any significant use of Anypoint Studio, Mule, and our Cloud Solutions.

== Initial Setup

=== Check Hardware and Software Requirements

* Review the link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/hardware-and-software-requirements[Hardware and Software requirements] and make sure you meet the essentials.

=== Install Oracle JDK

* If operating Mule 3.7 or newer, download and install the latest version of Oracle JDK link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[here].

[TIP]
Java 7 is compatible with Mule 3.6 and below.

=== Download and Install Anypoint Studio

* See link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/download-and-launch-anypoint-studio[Download Anypoint Studio] for detailed instructions

* If you have any extensions you wish to add to Studio, such as premium connectors or the enterprise security package, see link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/installing-extensions[Installing Extensions]


== Credentials Setup

=== Configure Anypoint Platform Credentials

* To associate your Anypoint Platform account to your local development environment:

. Open Anypoint Studio *Preferences*.
. Go to *Anypoint Studio* > *Authentication*
. Click the *Add* button and enter your Anypoint Platform credentials

[NOTE]
--
link:/release-notes/anypoint-studio-6.1-with-3.8.1-runtime-update-site-1-release-notes[Studio 6.1.1] and newer allows you to log-in to Anypoint Platform using your configured link:/access-management/external-identity[federated external identity].

=== Obtain credentials to access paid components and controls

This process only needs to be done once. A project manager or whoever is responsible for project oversight should complete this step.

* Log in to the Support Portal link:https://support.mulesoft.com[here]. If you do not have credentials to log in, contact your Customer Success Manager.

* Click the "Case" tab located on the top of the Support Portal Home page.

* Click the "Create New Case" button, at the right of the page header.

* Fill out the required information (highlighted in red) and in the _Description_ field, include a request for your credentials.


== Development Environment Setup

=== Enable Private Cloud Edition Setup

link:/release-notes/anypoint-studio-6.2-with-3.8.3-runtime-release-notes[Anypoint Studio 6.2] and higher support the link:/anypoint-platform-private-cloud-edition/v/1.5/[Private Cloud Edition] of Anypoint Platform.

To set Private Cloud Edition Setup from Studio:

. Navigate to *Preferences*.
. Select the *Anypoint Studio* item from the left navigation bar.
. Select the *On-Premises* option.
. Select the *Use an On-Premises instance* check mark.

[TIP]

If you choose to use a self-signed certificate on your Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition installation, you need to:

. Install the certificate in your operative system.
. Import the same certificate to your JDK:
+
.Windows
[source]
----
keytool -import -keystore C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_92\jre\lib\security\cacerts -storepass changeit -file selfSignedCertificate.cer
----
+
.Unix/Linux
[source]
----
keytool -import -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -file selfSignedCertificate.cer
----
+
Where:
+
* `$JAVA_HOME` is the environment variable that defines where your JVM is installed.
* `selfSignedCertificate.cer` is the self-signed certificate that you are using in your Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.
* `changeit` is the default password for your JDK keystore. If you manually changed your default password, use your current password instead.
+
Note that you can either import the certificate to your existing keytool or create a new one and import your certificate there.

After configuring and enabling On-Premises support you can:

. Log in to your Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition from Studio configuring your platform's credentials following the steps link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/setting-up-your-development-environment#configure-anypoint-platform-credentials[described above].
. Configure link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/api-sync-reference[API Sync] and link:/api-manager/api-auto-discovery[API Autodiscovery] for APIs in your Private Cloud Edition platform.
. Access your On-Premises link:/getting-started/anypoint-exchange[Exchange] Artifacts.

=== Repositories Setup

==== Setup and Learn about Maven

Maven is a powerful build automation tool used for software project management. We highly urge our customers to use Maven, Gradle, or a similar in-house tool with any significant usage of MuleSoft software.

* Learn more about Maven http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/[here].

* Start learning how to use Maven with Mule link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/using-maven-in-anypoint-studio[here].

==== Setup Code Repository

Code Repositories facilitate the tracking and versioning of changes developers make to a software project; this enables several people to work on the same project simultaneously without creating conflicts among the changes and additions they make.

* Learn more about two recommended Code Repositories: link:http://subversion.apache.org/[Subversion] and link:http://git-scm.com/[Git].

* Start learning how to use Subversion with Studio link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/using-subversion-with-studio[here].

==== Setup a Maven Repository Manager

A repository manager is a dedicated server application designed to manage repositories (internal and third party) of binary components. +
The usage of a repository manager is a best practice for any significant usage of Maven. Check link:http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/downloads/[Nexus] and link:http://www.jfrog.com/open-source/[Artifactory] as an example.


==== Configure MuleSoft Repositories

* Open the Repository Manager of your choice and configure a Proxy repository with the following information:
** Repository ID: muleee
** Repository Name: MuleSoft EE Repository
** Set up Remote Storage Location: `+https://repository.mulesoft.org/nexus-ee/content/repositories/releases-ee/+`
** Set the authentication method to use the User Name and password obtained from Support.


== Manage your built-in Mule Runtimes

=== Adding Mule Runtimes

* Anypoint Studio always comes bundled with the latest enterprise version of the Mule Runtime. If you wish to install any prior or beta version of the Runtime to develop applications with it in Studio, see link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/studio-update-sites[Updating Studio, Mule and Components].

* If you wish to develop applications with the free Community version of the Mule Runtime, see link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/adding-community-runtime[Installing Community Edition of Mule Runtime]


=== Deploying to Production Environments

Anypoint Studio comes bundled with the latest runtime for deploying and testing your applications. This server, however, is not meant for production as uptime restrictions apply. To deploy an application to your production environment you can either use:

* The link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager], to deploy to a cloud or a local server/server-group/cluster
* A link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/downloading-and-starting-mule-esb[standalone local Mule server]
* The link:/mule-management-console/v/3.8/[Mule Management Console] to manage local servers (which will be deprecated in the future)
